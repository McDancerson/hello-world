CS love: the Renaissance 

Really scared of the fact that this is "public," and that someone at some future date is going to find this and realize what a numrod I actually am.  But I'm actually not...?  Really need to work on that whole self-confidence thing.  Or alternatively, just learn to not give a fuck what others think.  It's just... as an introvert/other "minority" groups... it's hard to explain how I think sometimes, and it drives me crazy to be misinterpreted.

Anyhow, here goes nothing... or everything really.  "All in" and all that...
